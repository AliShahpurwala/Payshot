### Resources
* [Official Git Online Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) -- Read the first 3 chapters, that should give you more than enough knowledge to help get us started. I used this book to learn it when I learnt Git in first year. It's very beginner friendly and it'll get you up and running quick :)
